        <h2>We Are</h2>
        <p>Project Caring & Sharing has quickly become a driving force for the community, providing classes to local churches, daycare centers, schools, DCFS, Probation, and DPSS clients.
        </p>
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p> 
        Project Caring & Sharing is a private, non-profit 501(C)(3) organization. Since 1981, Project Caring & Sharing has provided emergency food banks, clothing, and personal hygiene items giveaways, health fairs, back-to-school giveaways, holiday food baskets and holiday toys giveaways to single heads of households, senior citizens and the working poor in the Pomona Valley, San Gabriel Valley and the Inland Empire. </p>
        <p>
          It is our desire to continue to meet the growing needs of our communities which will help us to encompass a more holistic approach by offering additional services such as our Academic Mentoring Program, Family Support Classes and our Re-entry Programs.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to provide high quality services to individuals (youth and adults) and families in a safe nurturing, family oriented, multi-cultural, multi-age learning environment that will promote academic excellence, promote positive self-image and educational enthusiasm resulting in responsible productive citizens.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>
          In short, our goal is to SAVE LIVES AND REUNITE FAMILIES. We believe the family is the most important institution in our society. We have accepted the challenge to strengthen two of the most vital educating institutions - the FAMILY and the SCHOOL.
