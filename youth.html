					<h2>Academic Mentoring Program</h2>
					<p>WE ARE:
					<br>Project:  Caring & Sharing is a private, non-profit organization.  Since 1981, Project: Caring & Sharing has provided weekly food banks, clothing & personal hygiene items giveaways, health fairs, back-to-school giveaways, holiday food baskets and holiday toys giveaway to single heads of households, senior citizens and the working poor in the Pomona Valley, San Gabriel Valley and the Inland Empire. It is our desire to continue to meet the growing needs of our communities which will help us to encompass a more holistic approach by offering additional services such as our Academic Mentoring Program.  </p>

					<p>WHAT IS ACADEMIC MENTORING:  
					The Academic Mentoring Program matches children, ages 8 year old to 18 years old with a enthusiastic volunteer mentor who serves as a role model for students engaged in the learning process.  Our academic mentors provide tutoring services as well as serve as a counselor and confidant to the student and ensure the student takes advantage of all resources that are available to help with the learning process.</p>

					<br><p>TARGET GROUP:
					<br>Our Academic Mentoring program concentrates on, but is not limited to, foster children who may have:
					<ul>
						<li>academic challenges</li>
						<li>behavior issues</li>
						<li>emotional trauma</li>
						<li>and/or may have a parent who is incarcerated</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<p>PROGRAM GOALS:
					<br>Our goals are:
					<ul>
						<li>to see improvement in core academic subjects;</li>
						<li>to see a reduction in the number of unexcused absences from school</li>
						<li>to see positive changes in student behavior and attitude, anger management, self-esteem abilities, anti-social behavior and decision-making.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<p>VOLUNTEER MENTORS:
					<br>Our academic mentors are student volunteers from the Claremont Colleges, Western University, University of La Verne, and Cal Poly Pomona, who have been interviewed, selected on the basis of several factors including a strong desire to participate in the program, and matched with a child/youth based on shared interests.  </p>

					<p>PROGRAM DAYS & HOURS OF OPERATION:
					<br>Our Academic Mentoring program meets on Tuesdays & Thursdays from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in Hahn Hall, Room 101 at Pomona College.
